# Octave_signal
Some changes to Octave's signal package

Should have made this before, but now, here's the first github'ed version of Octave/signal/firls.m.
The name is lsfir2.m to be able to be used separately of firls.m, e.g. lsfir2(11,[0 .3 .4 1],[1 1 0 0],[1 10]).
When/if the script is accepted, it can be renamed afterwards.
