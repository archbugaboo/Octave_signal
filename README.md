# Octave_signal
Some changes to Octave's signal package

Should have made this before, but now, here's the first github'ed version of Octave/signal/firls.m.
The name is lsfir2.m to be able to be used separately of firls.m, e.g. lsfir2(11,[0 .3 .4 1],[1 1 0 0],[1 10]).
When/if the script is accepted, it can be renamed afterwards.

There numbers should be spot on, compared to the Matlab script, for everything except the 1/f^2 weighting (differentiator). Two such examples have been provided in the mailing list:

>>> h = firls(11, [0 200 300 512]/512, [0 1 0 0], 'd');h'
> ans =
>    0.025308869942737
>   -0.018174108886369
>   -0.083194157264830
>    0.063294222003005
>    0.270747839846565
>    0.167064335397056

>    0.018174108886369
>   -0.025308869942737

and this is my result:
h =

   0.0255707581685783
  -0.0183683660855015
  -0.0831834477531340

and:

This happens, most probably, because of ways to circumvent Ci(0) (cosine integral) and cos(0)/0. How, I don't know, but, initially, I forced the starting frequency to be 1e-6 instead of zero, but that yielded large numbers for the q and b vectors, which, no doubt, took their toll on precision. Now I simply forced the values to come out as zero for cos(0)/0, and Ci(0) for the cosine integral.

Octave's expint() has numerical problems for purely imaginary arguments (which are needed here), and they go worse as the argument's value increases. Temporary solution: create a separate variant for the exponential integral, E1(x), and use that.

With this change, the numbers come out just as with wxMaxima's and, given the existent examples, I dare say my results are better than Matlab's. If I am wrong, I am wrong, my apologies to the giant, but I only say this after I plot diff(abs(fft(h))), which shows a clear difference between the two results, with a much better ripple towards DC, and a visible 1/f^2 progressiob of the ripples.
